            <p class="para1"> This is a direct quote from the anime: "All people must one day turn to ash, so too must
                nations fall to ruin, despite the capitols wealth and prosperity, it has become mired in corruption. The
                pompus and the vile run rampid throughout the city. These demons are beyond salvation, and are therefore
                silenced in the darkness, by an elite team of assassins." Anyone who is thinking about getting into
                anime, or if you already watch it, I HIGHLY recomend this anime. I give it five stars, for plot and
                character development. It does get sad, as a warning. And for some of the villans I wish I could pull
                them out of the screen AND RIP THEIR- Wait wait. I'm keeping it proffesional. Now this is an amazing
                anime. My own opinion, and you may not think the same, but try it and see. Akame ga Kill gets a five
                star rating from me. This is the end of my first blog/review. So until next time! </p>
